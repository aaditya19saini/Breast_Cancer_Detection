# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on various cell nucleus features.  
Built using Python, this notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation — all in one place.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection through data-driven models can drastically improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

In this project, we:
- Load and explore the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms.
- Visualize model performance and metrics.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  

*(You can adjust this list to match your actual models.)*

## Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available through `sklearn.datasets`.

**Features:**  
- Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.  
- 30 numerical features describing characteristics of cell nuclei.  

**Target:**  
- `0` → Malignant  
- `1` → Benign
